CACHING:
	- stories
	- mydesk
	- readstory
	- Make sure I'm updating at all the appropriate times (e.g. when adding a story)


main.py:
	- cache every commonly-used query.
	- figure out how to use logging so that I can debug after shipping

Ideas for the 2nd launch:
	big ideas:
	- AUDIO with soundcloud
	- Leaderboard and student stats
	- Add dictionary-lookup capability somehow
	
	little things:
	- add location property to questions
	- scroll to answer after submitting an answer
	

	
	


Failures to return to:
	I need to get the jHtmlArea in addstory.html to light up green when focused.
	
	to get the exact length of jHtmlArea to align with the other textareas I can
	just fiddle with #story's width I think.

	
Cron jobs to run:
	- Delete vocab which isn't being referred to.
	- Update all the thanks at the end of the day and keep track of increment in memcache.
