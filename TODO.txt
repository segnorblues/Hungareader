Next:

AddStory:
	- create a branch to test out how it would work without jHtmlArea

MyDesk:
	- figure out how to query words
	- figure out the temp list and quizes

main.py:
	- cache every query.

Welcome:
	- create a welcome page for not-logged-in users

General:
	- Make favicon (a white lobster H with red backdrop)
		
		
		
		
		
		
Ideas for the 2nd launch:
	- add a hide meaning tab to my_vocab_tools
	- add a view_printable tab to my_vocab_tools
	- add location property to questions
	- add ability to delete questions and answer posted by student
	- scroll to answer after submitting an answer
	
	- maybe I should convert the stories to plain textareas rather than jHtmlArea
	

	
	


Failures to return to:
	I need to get the jHtmlArea in addstory.html to light up green when focused.
	
	to get the exact length of jHtmlArea to align with the other textareas I can
	just fiddle with #story's width I think.

	
Cron jobs to run:
	- Delete vocab which isn't being referred to.
	- Update all the thanks at the end of the day and keep track of increment in memcache.
	
	
	

random old stuff:
