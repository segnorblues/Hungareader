CACHING:
	- readstory
		- Do the Question and Answer queries.
		- Do the StoryExtras queries.
		- Do the vocablist/vocab queries.  Should I cache vocab? and How?
	- mydesk
	- Nick Johnson has written a cool MonkeyPatch for caching datastore gets locally without using memcache.
	The life of the cache is only one request, so it's only good when there are a lot of get requests for the
	same entity during the request.
	See:	http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1174075/appengine-cached-reference-property
	

Create Footer:
	Welcome/About/Feedback/Bugs:
	- create a welcome page for not-logged-in users and a front page


General TODOs:
	- create admin tools which I can access after shipping
		- page with users, stats, etc. (this could be public too)
		- page which allows editing and deleting entities and their descendants (like datastore viewer but better)
		- find a way for me and Bal√°zs to be able to always see the "edit" and "delete" buttons on every page.
	- Make favicon (a white lobster H with red backdrop)
	- Create an editstory page.
	- How can students edit their info?
	- How to prevent spam?
	- figure out how to use logging so that I can debug after shipping



Lesson learned:
	- The ancestor query is what allows for consistency between entity groups. I tried to add a question to the
	database and then call Story_unanswered(update=True) and it wouldn't detect the new question.
	I added the class StoryParent of which there will always be one instance which all stories will have as a parent.
	Now certain methods will require the use of the kw argument parent=StoryParent_key(), like for example
	Story.get_by_id kept returning None until I changed that.



		
		
		
Ideas for the 2nd launch:
	big ideas:
	- AUDIO with soundcloud
	- Leaderboard and student stats
	- Add dictionary-lookup capability somehow
	
	little things:
	- add location property to questions
	- scroll to answer after submitting an answer
	

	

	
Cron jobs to run:
	- Delete vocab which isn't being referred to.
	- Update all the thanks at the end of the day and keep track of increment in memcache.
	
	
	

random old stuff:
