Next:

MyDesk:
	- figure out how to query words
		- get the words to show in reverse order of when they were added
	- figure out the temp list and quizes
		- make everything look nicer
		- make it so that the query parameters are saved somehow.

main.py:
	- cache every query.

Welcome:
	- create a welcome page for not-logged-in users

General:
	- Make favicon (a white lobster H with red backdrop)
	- .strip() whenever getting things and putting in db
	- set max characters for all text_areas, etc.
	
		
		
		
		
		
Ideas for the 2nd launch:
	- add a hide meaning tab to my_vocab_tools
	- add a view_printable tab to my_vocab_tools
	- add location property to questions
	- add ability to delete questions and answer posted by student
	- scroll to answer after submitting an answer
	- add audio (maybe host on soundcloud)
	

	
	


Failures to return to:
	I need to get the jHtmlArea in addstory.html to light up green when focused.
	
	to get the exact length of jHtmlArea to align with the other textareas I can
	just fiddle with #story's width I think.

	
Cron jobs to run:
	- Delete vocab which isn't being referred to.
	- Update all the thanks at the end of the day and keep track of increment in memcache.
