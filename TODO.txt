Next:

main.py:
	- cache every commonly-used query.

Create Footer:
	Welcome/About/Feedback/Bugs:
	- create a welcome page for not-logged-in users and a front page

General:
	- Make favicon (a white lobster H with red backdrop)
	- see about adding a youtube video

	
		
		
		
		
		
Ideas for the 2nd launch:
	- add a hide meaning tab to my_vocab_tools
	- add a view_printable tab to my_vocab_tools
	- add location property to questions
	- add ability to delete questions and answer posted by student
	- scroll to answer after submitting an answer
	- add audio (maybe host on soundcloud)
	

	
	


Failures to return to:
	I need to get the jHtmlArea in addstory.html to light up green when focused.
	
	to get the exact length of jHtmlArea to align with the other textareas I can
	just fiddle with #story's width I think.

	
Cron jobs to run:
	- Delete vocab which isn't being referred to.
	- Update all the thanks at the end of the day and keep track of increment in memcache.
