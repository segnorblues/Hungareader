# Hungareader

A web application for my Hungarian students.  The main idea: Read stories. Learn words.

### Getting Started

After pulling all the files in this repo, you will need to add a file `secrets.py` to /utilities/. In this file you should define two strings -- __secret__ and __encryption_key__ -- to be whatever you like. The `.gitignore` file has already been configured to ignore `secrets.py` so that it won't be included in commits.
